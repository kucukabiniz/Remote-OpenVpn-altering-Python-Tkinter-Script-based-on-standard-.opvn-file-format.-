# Remote-OpenVpn-altering-Python-Tkinter-Script-based-on-standard-.opvn-file-format.-
this tkinter-python script will reach the end-users goals efficiently only by modifying the credentials, especially when arm based devices (rasp, orange pi) being used as a router and vpn-tunneling tool over SSH . 
in order to get tkinter work through ssh, you have to forward your connection to x11. 
after installing openvpn to your device simply create a folder "others" .
place all your preferable *.ovpn configurations in that folder. 
the creditantials /user-pass info/ will be kept in the original opvn files (or through the link in the files) -! not in this script ! 
you can alternatively ignore the tkinter function and simply apply the opvn file-swap based modification on the SSH terminal.
